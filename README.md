# Getting started with PiPo dynamic libraries in JUCE

#### simple JUCE example of a PiPo host using PiPo modules compiled as dynamic libraries

This example uses a particular chain of PiPo descriptors to detect onsets in the input signal.  
It shows how to implement a PiPo host and rely on the [PiPo SDK](http://github.com/Ircam-RnD/pipo-sdk) to easily create and use any PiPo chain.
